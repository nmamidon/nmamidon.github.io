			<h1>Philosophy of the Antifa</h1>

			<p>So, the antifa don't have a central "group" and are essentially a loose label anyone can adopt.  You cannot be a "member" of the antifa as it has no official members, you simply take up the mantel and combat fascism in any way you can.<p>

			<h1>Creativity is Air</h1>

			<h5>Air w a y o f l i f e</h5>
			<p>If creativity (doing creative things) is a way of life, is the air I breathe, is just the default mode of existence, I feel relief.  I don't have to figure everything out, I can process the world and just, create, and transform whatever I want.  Digesting the world and funnelling it through the Nicole matrix, seeing what comes out the other side.  Not comparing myself to what I "should" be doing, just doing what I want to do, which is live a creative, interesting, connected life.<p>

			<h1>ANOTHER THOUGHT</h1>

			<p>A short randomeeee<p>
			<p>and another paragraph.  What fun this is indeed.  Such fun!  Really, really it is.  And what am I even going to do today?  I think imma do this, then go to the polls, and maybe wake up early tomorrow to deal the fuck with health insurance fuckery.  Also maybe put my name down to volunteer for artisan's asylum again.  Still don't know what time to actually carve out for a regular deskie schedule.  We'll see what happens.</p>
