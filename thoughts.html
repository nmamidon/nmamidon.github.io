			<h2>Philosophy of the Antifa</h2>

			<p>So, the antifa don't have a central "group" and are essentially a loose label anyone can adopt.  You cannot be a "member" of the antifa as it has no official members, you simply take up the mantel and combat fascism in any way you can.<p>

			<h2>Creativity is Air</h2>

			<h5>Air w a y o f l i f e</h5>
			<p>If creativity (doing creative things) is a way of life, is the air I breathe, is just the default mode of existence, I feel relief.  I don't have to figure everything out, I can process the world and just, create, and transform whatever I want.  Digesting the world and funnelling it through the Nicole matrix, seeing what comes out the other side.  Not comparing myself to what I "should" be doing, just doing what I want to do, which is live a creative, interesting, connected life.<p>

			<h2>Extra Step</h2>
			<br>
			<p>Maybe taking the extra step of "Planning" between thinking of something to do and doing it is unnecessary, unless I actually won't remember to do it because I'm too busy (like Jira tasks).<p>
			<br>
			<p><b>Planning, functioning as reassurance in this way, is an unecessary expenditure of energy.</b></p>

			<h2>Experience "Figures It Out"</h2>
			<br>
			<p>Feeling like I need to "figure it out" might be a misunderstanding of life.  Some knowledge is only "figur out"-able through experience.  There's some stuff that only can be known, really deeply emotionally gut-level <i>known</i>, through experience.  So "figuring it out" isn't going to figure anything out.</p>
			<br>
			<p>And with this, its okay to not spend time constantly thinking over my emotions, its okay to just be bored or interested in a different activity, and give energy to "things" rather than "thoughts".  Thoughts are circular, and without new experiences can only go so far in gaining wisdom.  So I can be at ease not thinking every thought is the most important thing ever, and let my focus be on activities.  I can allow myself to feel bored as well.</p>
