			<p>WHAT AOH WHOAH<p>
			<p>So many thoughts, how can I possibly write in a blog though?  How do I build that?  Or should I do it all in the html.  What an interesting blog experience that would be.  Very interesting indeed.  This page could use some work indeddddeeeeed!<p>

			<h1>ANOTHER THOUGHT</h1>

			<p>A short randomeeee<p>
			<p>and another paragraph.  What fun this is indeed.  Such fun!  Really, really it is.  And what am I even going to do today?  I think imma do this, then go to the polls, and maybe wake up early tomorrow to deal the fuck with health insurance fuckery.  Also maybe put my name down to volunteer for artisan's asylum again.  Still don't know what time to actually carve out for a regular deskie schedule.  We'll see what happens.</p>
