			<h5>List of Unrealistic Expectations</h5>
			<p>Drop the expectation that I’ll learn JavaScript by summer, and will have a mind mapping app working by then.  I won’t, this app will take years.  But that’s okay, I want it to be really good, and know I’ll stay interested in it because I’ve wanted this for years anyway.</p>

			<p>Instead?  I can slowly chip away at JavaScript and the mind mapping app, confident that consistent effort will eventually lead me to these goals, but that it will take a few years.  Instead of diving straight into a really complex app I can start by making my own website, which I gotta do anyway.  I can make smaller little apps, and really forge a dense (and sparkly) granite foundation to base my work off of.  No need to rush, it will take a while.</p>

			<p>Another unrelistic expectation is that writing these kinds of things and doing hardcore thinking/reflecting on my life is “time wasted”.  It’s not - I need to do it to have clarity and reference.  I’m a fallible, crazy human and haven’t memorized my whole ideology here.  That said, there is a difference between this kind of writing and writing to procrastinate, wallow, or be self-indulgent.  In this, I’m actually trying to focus and learn something from the writing, and have it be useful to read later.  Like, I need to read these thoughts, so lucid-past-Nicole can talk down extremely-stressed-future-Nicole.  It’s helped already!  And also, maybe I can post this stuff somewhere, or make it palatable for others, and hopefully they’ll find it useful as well.  (I also have a sneaking suspicion that these kinds of thoughts and reflections are extremely important).</p>

			<p>Instead of that unrealistic expectation, I’ll look at writing this stuff like I’ll look at any other thing I’m working on - it’s time well spent, towards doing a specific thing (like how this is specifically, trying out a mindset and set of things to do for next week).  And I’ll expect myself to spend time on it each week, and when I’m feeling unsure or unclarified, I’ll know I can read or write to uncover and solidify these aspects of myself.</p>
