			<h2>Simulacra and Simulation</h2>
			<br>
			<p>
				Listened to a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCgoKIT0Ufc">podcast</a> on this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulacra_and_Simulation">book</a>.  I get that, if the whole world is communicating through simulacra, then yes it doesn't matter what the Real world actually contains, since everyone is operating on the level of simulacra.  However, here on planet earth in 2019, the simulacra world and the Real world actually do overlap meaningfully.  There are moral implications to the idea that we are far removed from <b>Real</b> reality by the media, and that it doesn't matter in day to day life whether we understand this <b>Reality</b>.  As in, the Matrix metaphor breaks down pretty quickly when looked at from a moral angle.
			</p>
			<br>			
			<p>
				It breaks down because the <b>Real</b> reality and the <b>Simulated</b> reality overlap way more than they do in the matrix.  If you live in a war torn area, and someone across the sea votes in someone who will definitely war-tear your region WAY MORE, this means the "simulation" person is affecting the "real" person <i>meaningfully</i>.  
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				So, even if your immediate community lives in a world full of simulacra and you communicate with them through the use of simulacra, if your actions within that community affect other regions that are distorted through the simulacra you consume daily, then you need to understand the Reality behind the simulacra presented to you.  Your misunderstanding does directly affects other people.

			<h2>Philosophy of the Antifa</h2>

			<p>So, the antifa don't have a central "group" and are essentially a loose label anyone can adopt.  You cannot be a "member" of the antifa as it has no official members, you simply take up the mantel and combat fascism in any way you can.<p>

			<h2>Creativity is Air</h2>

			<h5>Air w a y o f l i f e</h5>
			<p>If creativity (doing creative things) is a way of life, is the air I breathe, is just the default mode of existence, I feel relief.  I don't have to figure everything out, I can process the world and just, create, and transform whatever I want.  Digesting the world and funnelling it through the Nicole matrix, seeing what comes out the other side.  Not comparing myself to what I "should" be doing, just doing what I want to do, which is live a creative, interesting, connected life.<p>

			<h2>Extra Step</h2>
			<br>
			<p>Maybe taking the extra step of "Planning" between thinking of something to do and doing it is unnecessary, unless I actually won't remember to do it because I'm too busy (like Jira tasks).<p>
			<br>
			<p><b>Planning, functioning as reassurance in this way, is an unecessary expenditure of energy.</b></p>

			<h2>Experience "Figures It Out"</h2>
			<br>
			<p>Feeling like I need to "figure it out" might be a misunderstanding of life.  Some knowledge is only "figur out"-able through experience.  There's some stuff that only can be known, really deeply emotionally gut-level <i>known</i>, through experience.  So "figuring it out" isn't going to figure anything out.</p>
			<br>
			<p>And with this, its okay to not spend time constantly thinking over my emotions, its okay to just be bored or interested in a different activity, and give energy to "things" rather than "thoughts".  Thoughts are circular, and without new experiences can only go so far in gaining wisdom.  So I can be at ease not thinking every thought is the most important thing ever, and let my focus be on activities.  I can allow myself to feel bored as well.</p>
